# OBD PIDs for the Kia Niro PHEV

This PIDs are based on the Kia Niro HEV PIDs, adding cell voltage and all modules temp from ioniq PHEV PIDs. Unafortunally I can't check this PIDs in a PHEV model so ther are untested.

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show OBD data](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)
